```

## Subtle Animations & User Interactions:

### **Visual Glitches:**
- VHS scanline overlay with flickering opacity
- Random hue-rotation flashes every few seconds
- Text glitch on hover (numbers jump/scale)
- Button press causes brief screen shake

### **Scroll Behaviors:**
- Main text: 60-second horizontal loop with intentional hiccups
- Bottom text: 30-second loop, slightly different speed
- Both have subtle random frame drops for "broken" feel

### **Hover States:**
- Intermission prompts pause on hover, become clickable
- Progress numbers get pixel-shift glitch effect
- Terminal button gets subtle background glow

### **Interactive Elements:**
- Any key dismisses intro screen
- Birthday calculator with instant feedback
- Audio toggle (heartbeat at ~40 BPM)
- Hidden terminal with command system

## Hidden Easter Eggs & Existential Humor:

### **Terminal Commands:**
- `help` - Shows available commands
- `reset` - "are you sure you want to start over? some progress may be lost forever"
- `newgame` - "character creation disabled / you are who you are"
- `cheats` - Lists philosophical "cheat codes" like "‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí‚Üê‚ÜíBA - unlimited love"
- `status` - Shows player stats like "conscious: true / breathing: automatic"
- `whoami` - "you are the player / you are the game / you are the creator / recursion detected"
- `why` - "because you asked / because you are here / because why not?"
- `meaning` - "42 / just kidding / the meaning is the search for meaning"
- `exit` - "there is no exit / only respawn / see you in the next level"

### **Konami Code Easter Egg:**
- Input ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí‚Üê‚ÜíBA triggers screen glitch
- Shows message: "‚àû UNLIMITED LOVE ACTIVATED ‚àû / you are loved / you are enough"

### **Code Comments as Philosophy:**
```html
<!-- are you reading this? you're supposed to be living -->
<!-- if you're here, you're probably overthinking -->
<!-- the real game is outside this browser -->
<!-- but also, welcome fellow digital archaeologist -->
```

## Audio/Ambience Suggestions:

### **Primary Audio:**
- **Heartbeat:** Subtle, under 40 BPM, creates underlying anxiety/urgency
- **Toggle button:** Top-right corner (üîä/üîá)
- **Generated programmatically** using Web Audio API for compatibility

### **Additional Atmospheric Options:**
- **Quiet static/white noise** (like old TV between channels)
- **Distant digital chimes** (rare, random, like notification sounds from another dimension)
- **Breathing sounds** (inhale/exhale at meditation pace)
- **Keyboard clicks** (when terminal is active)

### **Audio Interactions:**
- Heartbeat intensifies slightly when hovering over life statistics
- Brief audio glitch when visual glitches occur
- Terminal commands have subtle typing/beep sounds
- Easter eggs trigger unique audio signatures

## Target Vibe Achievement:

‚úÖ **Introspective** - Life calculator forces self-reflection  
‚úÖ **Uncanny** - Glitch effects and broken aesthetics  
‚úÖ **Artsy but unpretentious** - Clean typography, thoughtful interactions  
‚úÖ **Painfully honest** - Direct questions about mortality and purpose  
‚úÖ **Self-aware tutorial screen** - Meta-commentary on life as game  
‚úÖ **Beautifully depressed** - Elegant melancholy with hope underneath  

## Technical Implementation:

- **CSS animations** for all glitch effects
